# MATLAB SHARPE RATIO PORTFOLIO

## Overview
This project implements an optimization algorithm in MATLAB to perform matrix calculations and optimize variables using gradient descent techniques and primary goal is to minimize a cost function by iteratively adjusting the variables to achieve the optimal solution.

## Files
- `main.m`: The main script that executes the optimization process.
- `plotResults.m`: A helper script that generates plots for the optimization results.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (tested on version R2023a or higher).

## Setup
1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `main.m` script in MATLAB.
3. Make sure all files are in the same directory or add the appropriate paths.

## Usage
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.m` script.
3. Run the `main.m` script to start the optimization process.
4. The script will generate output plots, including:
   - A functional progression plot showing the convergence over iterations.
   - Variable progression plots showing the changes in decision variables throughout the optimization process .

## Example Output
- **Convergence Plot**: A plot that demonstrates how the cost function approaches its minimum over time.
- **Variable Progression Plot**: Visual representation of how the decision variables change as the optimization progresses.

## Results
The optimization algorithm is expected to converge towards an optimal solution, the progress of the optimization can be tracked through the plots, which display how both the objective function and the variables evolve during each iteration.
